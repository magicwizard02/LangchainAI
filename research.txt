### NewJeans Overview
---
NewJeans (Korean: 뉴진스; RR: Nyujinseu) is a South Korean girl group formed by ADOR, a sub-label of Hybe. The group consists of five members: Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin, and Hyein. They are known for their 'girl next door' image and their musical styles that are reminiscent of the 1990s and 2000s.

### Debut and Initial Success
---
NewJeans debuted on July 22, 2022, with the single "Attention," which became their first number-one song on South Korea's Circle Digital Chart. This was followed by two more singles, "Hype Boy" and "Cookie," with "Hype Boy" achieving the distinction of being the longest-running song on the Billboard Global 200 by a K-pop female act. These singles were part of their self-titled debut extended play (EP), released in August 2022.

In January 2023, they released their first single album, "OMG," which was commercially successful and included the singles "Ditto" and "OMG." "Ditto" created significant buzz and became the longest-running number-one song on the Circle Digital Chart, and marked their first entry on both the Billboard Hot 100 and UK Singles Chart.

### Further Achievements
---
The group's second EP, "Get Up," peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200 and sold over one million copies in South Korea. Its lead single, "Super Shy," became their highest-charting single on the Billboard Global 200, US Billboard Hot 100, and UK Singles Chart. NewJeans has garnered several rookie awards and has been featured in notable lists including Time's Next Generation Leaders and Forbes Korea Power Celebrity 40. In 2023, IFPI recognized them as the eighth best-selling artist worldwide.

### Management Issues
---
In 2024, conflicts arose regarding NewJeans' management, involving former ADOR CEO Min Hee-jin and the group members clashing with executives at Hybe and ADOR. The members aimed to terminate their contract, a request denied by ADOR. In March 2025, a court sided with ADOR, which resulted in blocking the group's independent activities, prompting the members to appeal with a hearing scheduled for April 2025. The group then announced a break from all activities in March 2025.

### Discography
---
NewJeans has released two extended plays, three single albums, ten singles, and five promotional singles since their debut. Their initial EP topped the South Korean Circle Album Chart, becoming the best-selling debut album by a K-pop female act, with over one million copies sold.
